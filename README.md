# Violent Crime Analysis
In this project my goal was to look for correlations between a states violent crime rate in the overall population and the student population.  The project can be found at https://public.tableau.com/profile/michael.truelsen#!/ and will also be included in the project files.

Analyzing crime statistics has always been something that has drawn my interest and when I was thinking of a project to do the obvious answer for me was something with that.  From there I started exploring the FBI statistics website and what I ended up going with was looking at any differences or similarities between violent crime in the overall population and the student population in 2016.

My first task was to find a way to analyze and visualize both student statistics and overall statistics.  I started by looking at the overall rates of violent crime and was able to conclude that the states with the most violent crime per 100,000 people in 2016 were Washington D.C., Colorado and Alaska.  I next looked at rates of violent crime in the student population and found that the states with the highest violent crime rates per 100,000 students in 2016 were New Hampshire, Massachusetts and New Mexico.

Finally, I looked at the two sets of data side by side and it became clear that there are no noticeable commonalities between each categories violent crime rates as can be seen in the Tableau visualization.  

*FBI crime statistics are gathered only from colleges reporting their numbers to the FBI.  This data does not include all campuses in all states by any means, but I find it suitable for the purposes of this project. 

The project files associated with this objective and their purpose are as follows:

State By City 2016.xls and State By College 2016.xls are the two datasets I pulled from the FBI's website for use in this project.

Violent Crime by State in Overall Population vs. Student Population.twbx is the Tableau project that can be downloaded and opened using Tableau desktop. 

Thank you so much for your time and attention!
