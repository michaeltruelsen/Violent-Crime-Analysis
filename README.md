# Violent Crime Analysis
In this project my goal was to look for correlations between a states violent crime rate in the overall population and the student population.  

In the end I was not able to find any correlations within the data I was working with.  In the project on Tableau I go through where I started and how I came to that conclusion.  The project can be found at https://public.tableau.com/profile/michael.truelsen#!/vizhome/ViolentCrimeinAmerica/StateResidentsvsStateStudents

On this page you will see the final dashboard of my project, with a Tableau account you will be able to further explore the project on the website using the explore option.  The Tableau file itself can be found in the GitHub files and can be downloaded for viewing using the Tableau Desktop program. 

*FBI crime statistics are gathered only from colleges reporting their numbers to the FBI.  This data does not include all campuses in all states by any means, but I find it suitable for the purposes of this project.
