# Violent Crime Analysis
In this project my goal was to look for correlations between a states violent crime rate in the overall population and the student population.  

In the end I was not able to find any correlations within the data I was working with.  In the project on Tableau I go through where I started and how I came to that conclusion.  The project can be found at https://public.tableau.com/profile/michael.truelsen#!/vizhome/ViolentCrimeinAmerica/StateResidentsvsStateStudents

On this page you will see the final dashboard of my project, with a Tableau account you will be able to further explore the project on the website using the explore option.
